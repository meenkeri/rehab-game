<b>Getting started with the game:</b>

The following these step-by-step instructions will help in getting started with the game.

1.	Download the game software. The total size of the software is about 60MB

2.	Unzip the downloaded folder by right clicking on the folder and select “Extract All…”

3.	Enter into the unzipped folder and you should see the following three items:
    •	Application Files
    •	rehabGame
    •	setup

4.	Install the software by double clicking the setup file

5.	You might be prompted with the security warning, but click on the Install

6.	Now you have the game software installed on your PC. But wait, before you start the game, the Wii Balance Board needs to be connected first

7.	Connecting the Wii Balance Board to the PC is known to be the biggest sticky point of all. The Wii Balance Board might not pair with and communicate with every Bluetooth device available. However the following steps are known to work:

    A.	Start your Bluetooth software and have it search for a device
    
    B.	On the Wii Balance Board, open the battery cover on the under side of the balance board and hold the little red sync          button
    
    C.	The balance board should show up in the list of devices as Nintendo RVL-WBC-01. If it isn’t there then start all over         again from Step A
    
    D.	Click next to move your way through the wizard and finish the wizard. If at any point you are asked to enter a                security PIN, leave the number blank or click skip. Do not enter any number as it is not required
    
    E.	Now go back to the initial unzipped folder and double click on rehabGame application file to start the game
    
    F.	You should see that a blue light is solid on the Wii Balance Board after you see the welcome page of the game. If you         don’t see the blue light blinking or no light at all then try the above steps again
    
    G.	If the Wii Balance Board continues to not function, you likely have an incompatible Bluetooth device
    
8.	That’s it. You are all set to play the game
